Assignments can be challenging, but very doable. Also, tests are challenging but if you did the assignments and study they are very manageable. Terrific professor, very respectful and encouraging!"

Tests are tough because he makes you really apply what you've learned, but he absolutely will not ask you things that he didn't go over in class as well as make sure to tell you to study. Must study and do assignments! Take him always!"
